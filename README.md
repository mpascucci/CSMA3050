## Description
LibreOffice is a free and open-source office productivity software suite, a project of The Document Foundation (TDF).
It was forked in 2010 from [OpenOffice.org](openoffice.org), an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice.
It consists of programs for **word processing**; creating and editing spreadsheets, **slideshows**, **diagrams**, and **drawings**; working with **databases**; and composing **mathematical formulae**.
It is available in [120 languages][1]
TDF does not provide support for LibreOffice, but enterprise-focused editions are available from companies in [the ecosystem][2].

## History
LirbeOffice is the most actively developed free and open-source office suite, with approximately 50 times the development activity of Apache OpenOffice, the other major descendant of OpenOffice.org, [in 2015](https://lwn.net/Articles/637735/).

The project was announced, and a beta was released on September 28, 2010. LibreOffice was downloaded about 7.5 million times between January 2011 (the first stable release) and October 2011.
